    "Crossover selects two parents, crossover the genetic materials of the parents, and produce one or more children. In the Travelling Salesman Problem, each travelling path must be valid. Each path consists all cities in the set, and each path visits each of the cities once only. So, none of the cities are visited more than once. Exchanging parts of two chromosomes tend to produce invalid paths. As an example, Parent 1 is [2 1 0 7 3 5 4 6] and Parent 2 is [6 1 0 5 2 3 4 7]. One point crossover at midpoint generates Child 1 [2 1 0 7 2 3 4 7] and Child 2 [6 1 0 5 3 5 4 6]. Both children are invalid paths.     "
